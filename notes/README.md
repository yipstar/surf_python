Regardless of these limitations, wave models do a remarkable job of predicting sea heights out to 2 days, with reasonable accuracy out to 3 days. If you view the wave model "00hr Hindcast" in conjunction with the combined ERS-2 and SSM/I wind field data maps, one can quickly confirm the location of active large fetch areas, the high seas associated with that fetch, wind speed, direction, and the heading of the largest seas.

Start forecasting by following this doc:

Use local high-resolution atmospheric models (MM-5, MAPS, ETA) to determine what the local winds will be when the swell hits. Adding your understanding of local winds, tides and swell direction to the forecast, you're sure to know which breaks will be firing when the big one arrives!
